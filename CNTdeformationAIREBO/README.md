Molecular dynamics simulation of a CNT. The force field is AIREBO, and the initial configutation has been generated using TopoTools (https://sites.google.com/site/akohlmey/software/topotools) and VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

A video corresponding to the simulation is available here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1ve1j3yA6w.
