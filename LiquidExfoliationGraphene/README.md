# Liquid exfoliation of a multilayer nanographene

## Out-of-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations

### Step 1

From the Construction folder, run the GenerateData.m script using Matlab

### Step 2

From the Equilibration forder, run the input.lammps script using LAMMPS

### Step 3

finally, run the input.lammps cript within Run using LAMMPS. this perform a shearing simulation with a shear rate of 1e10 1/s


The following video has been made with this code (but larger shear rate of 200e10 1/s) :
