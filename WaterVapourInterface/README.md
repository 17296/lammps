## Vaporisation of a water slab using molecular dynamics simulation

### Description

Molecular dynamics simulation of a slab of water in contact with vacuum. The water model is TIP4P/2005. The temperature is increased from 20°C to 400°C. The total duration of the simulation is 0.1 nanosecond.

### How to

Run the GenerateData.m using octave or matlab, or just use the data.lammps already generated. Then, run the input.lammps using LAMMPS. Visualise the dump file using VMD of Ovito.
