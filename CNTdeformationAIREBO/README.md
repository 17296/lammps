## Deformation of a carbon nanotube using a reactive force field

Molecular dynamics simulation of a carbon nanotube. The reactive force field is AIREBO, and the initial configutation has been generated using TopoTools (https://sites.google.com/site/akohlmey/software/topotools) and VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

A step-by-step tutorial describing the generation of a carbon structure using VMD and TopoToolds is available here: https://lammpstutorials.github.io/

Just run the input.lammps file using LAMMPS.
