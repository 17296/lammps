## Deformation of a carbon nanotube using a reactive force field

Molecular dynamics simulation of a carbon nanotube under deformation. The CNT is divided into three parts (central part + 2 edges), and a displacement is imposed to the two edges, forcing the elongation of the CNT. Since a reactive force field (AIREBO) is used, chemical bonds eventualy break. The initial configuration has been generated using TopoTools (https://sites.google.com/site/akohlmey/software/topotools) and VMD (https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/).

Run the input.lammps file using LAMMPS.

A step-by-step tutorial describing the generation of a carbon structure using VMD and TopoTools is available here: https://lammpstutorials.github.io/
