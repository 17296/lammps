# Generation of amorphous carbon structure using the liquid quench method

### Description

LAMMPS [input script](input.lammps) for a carbon atoms, initially in the liquid state (high temperature). The temperature of the system is decreased progressively until hexagonal rings form. The final state is an amorphous nanoporous structure of carbon.

### Output

This [video](https://youtu.be/P6M7mJdh7uM) has been made with this script.
