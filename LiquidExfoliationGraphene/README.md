## Liquid exfoliation of a multilayer nanographene: out-of-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations

### Step 1

From the Construction folder, run the GenerateData.m script using Matlab

### Step 2

From the Equilibration forder, run the input.lammps script using LAMMPS

### Step 3

Finally, run the input.lammps cript within Run using LAMMPS. this perform a shearing simulation with a shear rate of 1e10 1/s

### Output

The following video has been made with this code using a shear rate of 200e10 1/s :
