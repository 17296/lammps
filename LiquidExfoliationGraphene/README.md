## Liquid exfoliation of a multilayer nanographene: out-of-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations

### Description

The simulation consists of a nanoparticle made of multiple graphene layers in a box of water. A linear shear is imposed thanks to two moving walls.  The shear rate of 1e10 1/s.

### How to

From the 'Construction' folder, run the GenerateData.m script using Matlab (Octave should also work with a few modification). From the 'Equilibration' folder, run the input.lammps script using LAMMPS. Finally, run the input.lammps cript within the 'Run' folder using LAMMPS.
