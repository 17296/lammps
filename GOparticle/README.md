### How to

Run the input.lammps file using LAMMPS, and visualise the 'dump' output using VMD. If you are new to LAMMPS and VMD, you can find [tutorials and instructions here](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/).

### Output

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DaTJFEyUmI) has been made with this script.
