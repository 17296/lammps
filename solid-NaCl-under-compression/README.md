### Description

The simulation consists of a block of NaCl atoms. The box size along x is reduced progressively.

### How to

Run the make-LAMMPS-data.ipynb script using Jupyter notebook. Execute the input.lammps file using LAMMPS. Visualise the dump file using VMD. If you are new to LAMMPS and VMD, you can find [tutorials and instructions here](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/).

### Output

This [video](https://youtu.be/aLIZ0N76XtQ) has been made with this script.
