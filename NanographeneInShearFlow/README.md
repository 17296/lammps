## The abnormal behaviour of graphene quantum dot in shear flow

### Description

The simulation consists of a molecule of hexabenzocoronene (sometimes referred to as the "molecular equivalent of graphene", or "graphene quantum dot") immersed in  water. A linear shear flow is imposed by two translating walls.

### How to

Run the GenerateData.m script using Matlab (or Octave). Then run the input.equilibrium.lammps script using LAMMPS. Finally run the input.lammps script using LAMMPS. The molecule structure has been downloaded from the ATB repository https://atb.uq.edu.au/. 

### Output
