## Generation of amorphous carbon structure  using the liquid quench method

### Description

The simulation consists of carbon atoms, initially in the liquid state (high temperature). The temperature of the system is decreased progressively, and hexagonal rings form.

### How to

Run the input.lammps file using LAMMPS, and visualise the 'dump' output using VMD or Ovito.
