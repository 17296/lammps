## Generation of amorphous carbon structure  using the liquid quench method

### Description

The simulation consists of carbon atoms, initially in the liquid state (high temperature). At the beginning of the simulation, a few atoms are removed from the CNT. The CNT is divided into three parts: the central part and the two edges. The two edges are forced to move, which leads to the gradual elongation of the CNT. Eventually, the CNT will break. The breaking of the chemical bonds is permit by the use of a reactive force field (AIREBO).

### How to

Simply run the input.lammps file using LAMMPS, and visualise the 'dump' output using VMD or Ovito.

### Output
