## Molecular dynamics simulation of a oil-water-vapor interface

### Description

Molecular dynamics simulation of a slab of initially mixed water and toluene molecules in contact with vacuum. The temperature is 300Â°K.

### How to

Run the make-data-file.m and make-parm-file.m using Octave or Matlab to create the lammps data and parameter files. Then, execute the input.lammps file using LAMMPS. Visualise the dump file using VMD. If you are new to LAMMPS and VMD, you can find [tutorials and instructions here](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/).
