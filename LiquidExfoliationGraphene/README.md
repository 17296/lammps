# Liquid exfoliation of a multilayer nanographene

## Molecular dynamic simualations

from Construction folder, run the GenerateData.m script using Matlab

from Equilibration forder, run the input.lammps script using LAMMPS

finally, run the input.lammps cript within Run using LAMMPS. this perform a shearing simulation with a shear rate of 1e10 1/s

The following video has been made with this code (but larger shear rate of 200e10 1/s) :
